# Blinking-led-with-Arduino
I have strucked with a problem statement that you have to connect the Arduino with 3 LEDs(IF you have only 2 LEDs then work with 2) at 3 different pins and control them i.e. turn them ON or OFF when you press Keyboard number keys 1,2, &amp; 3 respectively. Also, add to more functions in the program i.e. the use of "+" and "-" keys and when you press "+" key the blink speed for the LED that is ON increases by 0.25 secs and if pressed "-" key, the blink speed decreases by 0.25 secs. Whenever you turn ON any LED using any key from 1,2 or 3, the respective LED should turn ON &amp; blink at a delay of 1sec.   

Can I get the Arduino code ?
